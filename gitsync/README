README for GitSync
  A simple and small script to sync your remote git repo with your local one
   Just edit local repo and get remote one synchronized
Installation
  sudo cp gs /usr/bin
Usage
  *Note: You should have already installed 'git' and git repo
  If you are already in your local repo, just execute 'gs' and wait to calculate files and enter your username and password.  
  If you are in another directory and want to sync your git, just execute 'gs' followed by your local git directory.
