 KeySwapper, the easy way to make your keyboard multilingual
  this is a shell script to generate a setxkbmap line and make it "autostart"
  Usage:
    ./keyswap layout1,layout2,..,layoutN switch_keys indicator_led
    Example:
    ./keyswap us,ru,ara alt_shift scroll
     To use "us" and "ru" and "ara" layouts, and switch between them (toggle) using "alt"
     and "shift", and turn on "scroll" led when the current layout is NOT the first.
    Notes:
     If you didn't choose switch_keys or indicator_led, It'd be "alt_shift" and "scroll"
     If you don't want the led, You may type "none", like:
      ./keyswap us,ru,ara alt_shift none
