# Converting .grx files (getright list file) to a wget script ;)
# Usage: grx2wget /path/to/file.grx
# How to work:
#  make a temp file to work on
#  read every line in the original grx file
#  if the line begin with "URL:" make it "wget $URL -O "
#  and if it begins with "File:" continue the last line with it
#  but make C:, D:, .. to /home/user and change every \ to /
#  remove temp file
#  make directories
